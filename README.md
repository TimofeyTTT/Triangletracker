#Created by Timothy Ortega.

### Triangle Tracker takes the lengths of three sides and determines if they form a valid triangle. If so, the tracker returns the name of the kind of triangle the sides make (equilateral, isosceles, scalene).
------------------------------------------
###A triangle is scalene if all of its three sides are different (in which case, the three angles are also different). If two of its sides are equal, a triangle is called isosceles. A triangle with all three equal sides is called equilateral.
