# Triangle-Tracker
# Created by Timothy Ortega.
### Triangle Tracker takes the lengths of three sides and determines if they form a valid triangle. If so, the tracker returns the name of the kind of triangle the sides make (equilateral, isosceles, scalene) and also tells if it is not a triangle at all.
------------------------------------------
### A triangle is scalene if all of its three sides are different (in which case, the three angles are also different). If two of its sides are equal, a triangle is called isosceles. A triangle with all three equal sides is called equilateral.

## Bugs
There are no bugs but incase of one being found or dicovered let me know.

## Behavior Driven Development
1. Values Information / Input
2. Validate values and Verify if its a triangle 
3. If Validation & Verification Fails, Show value is not a triangle
4. Else, not a triangle
